## Motivation

Many News articles have reported high mortality/case-fatality rates in senior nursing homes across the U.S. Elderly people are much more vulnerable to COVID-19 compared to their younger counterparts. In this project, we focus on New York State and want to find out if there are uneven seniorsâ€™ infection rates/mortality/case-fatality distribution across different counties, and if they are relatively higher compared to whole country's situation. with different political standpoints. We also want to explore how political standpoints and nursing home facility may influence these observations.

## Data Sources

In this project, we are using 4 dataset sources:

[US nursing home data](https://data.cms.gov/stories/s/COVID-19-Nursing-Home-Data-Archived-Datasets/dyvx-s2qr)

From this dataset, we obtain the New York nursing home information, such as providers' names, COVID-19 weekly infection rate/deaths/availability of beds, staff information, and supply information. 

[NY nursing home profile data](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/nursing-home-profile)

The NYC nursing home profile data has different details focusing on the new york state. We are interested in the facility information dataset within, and we want to analyze the facility conditions after merging into the previous US nursing home dataset by its providers' names.

[Presidential election data for NY](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/new-york/)

As election day just passed, it will be interesting to observe the distributions of election data in different counties, and analyze if there is any significant findings related to it. We will separate counties into democratic or republican counties according to the election data listed, and examine the relationship with Covid infections/mortality rate.

[New York Statewide covid-19 testing data](https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/New-York-State-Statewide-COVID-19-Testing/xdss-u53e/data)

This dataset has COVID-19 testing information for the whole New York State beginning from the March. For each county, it has record of such as cumulative number of tests and cumulative positive cases. We use this information to catch the infection rate for each county.

[New York County fatality](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/state/new-york)

This dataset has COVID-19 cases and death information for the whole New York State, it has recorded the number of known cases and death. We use this information to catch the case fatality rate for each county.
