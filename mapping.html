<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Previous study <a href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(20)30736-2/fulltext#%20">Sun, 2020</a> has shown that the mortality/case-fatality rates in senior nursing homes are strongly associated with the disease prevalence. While it is challenging for us to calculate the monthly prevalence of Covid-19 since we could not obtain the county population by each month and the existing cases of Covid-19, it is wholesome to focus on the monthly infection rate instead. This page provides visual representations of Covid-19 patterns in 62 New York counties.</p>
<p>This interactive map records both the infection rate and the case fatality rate of Covid-19 for all counties in New York. Each circle represents the geographic location of the county seat and the radius of the circle is proportional to county’s Covid-19 infection rate and the color of the circle is corresponding to county’s Covid-19 fatality rate. Due to the limitation of incomplete dataset, only data on May 2020 is used.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This spaghetti line plot describes the monthly Covid-19 infection rate in 62 New York counties. From the plot, we have observed a peak in May and the rate went down in June and stayed at a row level for both July and August. Nonetheless, there appeara to be a resurgence in infection rate after August. The comeback of infection rate might be explained by the reopening policy of the state government. We will expect a further rebound of the infection rate as we enter the winter/flu season.</p>
